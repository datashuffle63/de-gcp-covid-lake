# DE Medallion Lake COVID

A data engineering portfolio project implementing medallion architecture for COVID-19 data processing, demonstrating end-to-end batch pipeline development with modern data practices.

## Overview

This project showcases a complete data engineering solution implementing the medallion architecture pattern (bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold) for processing COVID-19 and related datasets. It demonstrates batch processing pipelines, data quality frameworks, and cloud infrastructure implementation.

### Key Features

- Medallion architecture implementation
- End-to-end batch data pipelines
- Cloud infrastructure (GCP/AWS)
- Data quality framework
- Pipeline orchestration with Mage
- Monitoring and observability
